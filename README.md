# Judging Criteria - Moledao 2021 Hackathon



### üë©üèæ‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judging Criteria

Judges will be invited to vote on each project based on the following criteria. For each of the themes, they'll vote on a range from 1 - 5.

1. **Novel*
    
    Does it do something entirely novel, or at least takes a fresh approach to an old problem?
    
    1- I've seen this idea built before
    
    5- First time I read about this
    
    
2. **Technical Challenge**
    
    Is the project usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?
    
    1- Buggy, doesn't run
    
    2- Working design prototype, but no working code
    
    3- Working platform, built on no-code
    
    4- Executable on testnet, code runs locally
    
    5- Executable on mainnet, website deployed
    
3. **Commercial value**
    
    Is the project practical? Is it something you can perceive users actually using? Does it fulfill a real need people have or touch on a big pain point?
    
    1- Don't see its use within the current crypto ecosystem
    
    5- Can totally see this project being used by users 
    
4. **Presentation**
    
    How compelling was the presentation for the project? Demo? Slides? Pitch?
    
    1- The pitch was boring and the demo wasn't successful
    
    5- Pitch was attractive and compelling
